# We use input() to take input from the user like we used scanf() in C language.

# Here the input can be of any data type but the Python code will store the input data as the string data type. We can convert the data type of the input data using type conversion or type casting.

# If we want to take a specific data type as input, we can use the casting function to convert the data type of the input data to the required data type.
# For Example: age = int(input("Enter your age: ")) will take the input as a string data type and convert it to an integer data type.

input("Enter your name: ")
input("Enter your age: ")
input("Enter your contact number: ")
input("Enter your contact email: ")
input("Enter your college: ")
input("Enter your course duration: ")
input("Enter your batch: ")

# In the above example, the input data is stored as a string data type.

# Now we can use type cast to input the data as a specific data type.

input("Enter your name: ")
int(input("Enter your age: "))
int(input("Enter your contact number: "))
input("Enter your contact email: ")
input("Enter your college: ")
input("Enter your course duration: ")
input("Enter your batch: ")

# In the above example, the input data is stored as a specific data type.

# Remember, this is type casting and not type conversion. Type casting is done by the programmer and type conversion is done by the machine.
