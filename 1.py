# Python is a high-level open-source programming language. It is easy and simple to learn. It is a general-purpose programming language. It is used in web development, data science, machine learning, artificial intelligence, etc.
# Developed by Guido van Rossum in 1989. It was released in 1991.

# Extension of Python file is ".py".
