# First ever code in Python Programming Language!
# In any language, we start with a "Hello, World!" program.
# So, here it is in Python.

print("Hello, World!")

# Like in C language, we use printf() to display the output, in Python we use print() to display the output.
# This is a single line comment.
# The line above is a print statement.
# The print statement is used to display the output.
# In Python, we use double quotes to print a string.
# The string is "Hello, World!" in this case.
# The string is the output of this program.
# The output is displayed on the console.
# The console is the output window of the Python IDE.
# The Python IDE is the Integrated Development Environment.
# The Integrated Development Environment is the software used to write and run Python programs.
# The Python program is the code written in Python language.
# The Python language is a high-level programming language.
# The programming language is used to write computer programs.
# The computer programs are the set of instructions to perform a specific task.
# The specific task is the problem to be solved.
# The problem to be solved is the reason to write a computer program.
# The computer program is the solution to the problem.
# The solution is the output of the computer program.
# The output is the result of the computer program.
