# Lets perform some arithmetic operations in Python.

# Sum of 2 numbers ->
print(1+2)
# In this case we are not taking any input from the user. We are directly performing the operation and printing the output.

a=1
b=2
sum=a+b
print(sum)
# In this case we are using variable "sum" to perform the operation of addition on a and b. We are then printing the output.

# Similarly we can perform subtraction, multiplication, division and modulus operations.
